# DBT Cortex Analytics Project

This project demonstrates how to use dbt (Data Build Tool) with Snowflake Cortex for advanced analytics and Streamlit for building interactive data applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

-   `dbt/`: Contains all dbt-related files, including models, seeds, tests, and macros. This is where the data transformation logic resides.
-   `snowflake_sql/`: Holds supplementary SQL scripts or queries specific to Snowflake, potentially for setup, maintenance, or ad-hoc analysis.
-   `streamlit/`: Includes the Python scripts for the Streamlit application(s) that provide an interactive interface to the analytical insights.
-   `data/`: Intended for storing raw data files, seeds, or any other data assets used by the project.
-   `docs/`: Contains project documentation, which might include dbt docs, design documents, or other relevant information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Access to a Snowflake account.
-   Python and pip installed.
-   dbt Core installed.
-   (Add any other specific prerequisites here, e.g., specific Python versions, other tools)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Configure dbt:**
    -   Set up your `profiles.yml` for dbt to connect to your Snowflake instance. Refer to the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/snowflake-setup) for details.
    -   Ensure your Snowflake user has the necessary permissions for Cortex functions if used.
3.  **Install Python dependencies (if any, for Streamlit or scripts):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming a requirements.txt exists or will be created
    ```
4.  **(Add any other setup steps specific to your project, e.g., environment variable setup)**

### Running the Project

1.  **Run dbt models:**
    ```bash
    dbt run
    ```
    To run specific models:
    ```bash
    dbt run --select <model_name>
    ```
2.  **Run dbt tests:**
    ```bash
    dbt test
    ```
3.  **Generate dbt documentation:**
    ```bash
    dbt docs generate
    dbt docs serve
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    Navigate to the `streamlit/` directory and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run <your_streamlit_app_name>.py
    ```

## Key Features

-   Leverages Snowflake Cortex for advanced analytics functions (e.g., ML, forecasting).
-   Uses dbt for robust and maintainable data transformation pipelines.
-   Provides interactive data exploration and visualization through Streamlit.
